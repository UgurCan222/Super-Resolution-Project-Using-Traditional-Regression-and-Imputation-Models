# Image Upscaling with XGBoost

## Abstract

This project represents an exploratory study in the field of image resolution enhancement, utilizing advanced regression and imputation techniques to upscale color images. By leveraging the XGBoost machine learning model, the project aims to investigate the effectiveness of such techniques in predicting pixel values and enhancing image quality. The primary objective is to assess how well XGBoost can be applied to image processing tasks, specifically in the context of increasing image resolution through pixel prediction.

## Introduction

Image resolution enhancement, commonly known as image upscaling, is a crucial area of research in computer vision and image processing. Traditional methods of upscaling, such as interpolation techniques, often fall short in preserving the fine details and textures of the original image. Machine learning models, particularly those designed for regression and imputation, offer promising alternatives by predicting pixel values based on learned patterns from the data.

This study focuses on applying XGBoost, a robust gradient boosting algorithm, to the task of image upscaling. XGBoost has been widely recognized for its performance in various machine learning challenges, and its application to image resolution enhancement represents an innovative approach to leveraging its predictive capabilities.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation

The initial step involves loading a color image that serves as the input for the upscaling process. The image is processed to extract its pixel values, which will be used for training and prediction purposes. The image's dimensions are recorded to facilitate the subsequent expansion steps.

### 2. Column Expansion

The image is first expanded in terms of columns. This process involves adding new columns between existing ones. For each pixel in the original column, a new pixel is introduced and its value is predicted using XGBoost. The prediction is based on the values of adjacent pixels to the left and right. The model is trained on these neighboring pixel values to generate the new pixel values, effectively creating an expanded column.

The expansion is conducted sequentially for each column until the last column is reached, beyond which no further columns are added.

### 3. Row Expansion

Following the column expansion, the focus shifts to expanding the rows of the image. Similar to column expansion, new rows are introduced between existing rows. For each pixel in the original row, the value of a new pixel is predicted using XGBoost based on the values of neighboring pixels above and below. The model is trained on these adjacent pixel values to generate the new row pixels.

This process is performed for each row until the final row is processed, after which no additional rows are added.

### 4. Result Compilation

The final step involves saving the upscaled image to a specified file path. This image represents the enhanced version with increased resolution, generated through the application of the XGBoost model.

## Objectives and Contributions

The primary aim of this project is to explore the applicability of regression and imputation techniques for image resolution enhancement. By employing XGBoost, the study seeks to evaluate the potential of such models in producing high-quality upscaled images. The outcomes of this research are intended to provide insights into the effectiveness of machine learning models for image processing tasks, and to contribute to the ongoing advancements in the field of image resolution enhancement.

## Results and Discussion

The effectiveness of XGBoost in upscaling images will be analyzed based on the quality of the upscaled images and the accuracy of the pixel predictions. The results will be compared with traditional image upscaling methods to assess improvements in image detail and overall quality.
